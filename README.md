# SQL Loan Operations Analysis

This project is based on a practical SQL exercise developed during the Database with SQL module of my Big Data & Data Science Master's program. The dataset simulates loan operations and refunds related to purchases made by customers in various merchants.

## Overview

The objective was to analyze loan operations from 2015 using SQL. The data consists of three CSV files that were transformed into relational tables:

- `orders`: details of each loan operation.
- `refunds`: information about refunds associated with operations.
- `merchants`: list of merchants involved.

## Exercises Included

### Exercise 1: Database Design  
- Creation of an entity-relationship model.  
- Implementation of logical and physical models using DDL.  
- Loading data into MySQL from CSV files.  

### Exercise 2: Country & Operation Analysis  
- Aggregation and filtering of operations by country and status.  
- Identification of countries with the most operations and value extremes.  

### Exercise 3: Merchant Analysis  
- Analysis of total operations, refunds, and average values by merchant and country.  
- Creation of a view combining operation and refund information.  

### Exercise 4: Custom Insight  
- A personal proposal for additional business insight based on the data.  
- Query implementation and conclusion drawn from the results.
